/**
 * <p>To deregister a consumer, provide its ARN. Alternatively, you can provide the ARN of
 *             the data stream and the name you gave the consumer when you registered it. You may also
 *             provide all three parameters, as long as they don't conflict with each other. If you
 *             don't know the name or ARN of the consumer that you want to deregister, you can use the
 *                 <a>ListStreamConsumers</a> operation to get a list of the descriptions of
 *             all the consumers that are currently registered with a given data stream. The
 *             description of a consumer contains its name and ARN.</p>
 *         <p>This operation has a limit of five transactions per second per stream.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { KinesisClient, DeregisterStreamConsumerCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-kinesis"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { KinesisClient, DeregisterStreamConsumerCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-kinesis"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new KinesisClient(config);
 * const command = new DeregisterStreamConsumerCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeregisterStreamConsumerCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeregisterStreamConsumerCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link KinesisClientResolvedConfig | config} for KinesisClient's `config` shape.
